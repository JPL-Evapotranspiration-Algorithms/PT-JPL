    """
    Calculate fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (fIPAR) from NDVI.

    This function uses a linear empirical relationship:
        fIPAR = clip(NDVI, 0, 1) - 0.05
    The result is clipped to the range [0, 1] to ensure valid physical values.

    This approach is commonly used in remote sensing to estimate the fraction of sunlight intercepted by vegetation, which is important for ecological and agricultural modeling.
